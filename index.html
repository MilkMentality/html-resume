    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Currently, I am an undergraduate student at IUPUI pursuing a Chemistry B.S. degree. I have always been interested in research. 
        I am very passionate about chemistry and would like to eventually pursue a full-time career in the field later down the line. 
        I have a lot of experience with different lab devices and techniques due to the many science courses that I have taken thus far 
        including general chemistry 1&2, and organic chemistry 1&2. I have a passion for endeavors in computer science and intend on 
        pursuing a career in the field.</p>
    <p>I am also a figher and train many martial arts and intend on competing in some capacity whether it be in an amateur or professional arena.</p>
